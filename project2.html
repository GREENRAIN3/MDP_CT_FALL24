        <p>
            This project draws inspiration from Yoshi Sodeoka's rich generative art style. The theme of "growing" was explored through TouchDesigner, where I used a combination of transformations, camera adjustments, and procedural techniques to create visuals that feel alive and continuously expanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each process builds upon the last. I began with experimenting with dynamic camera work and transformation effects, simulating natural growth patterns. As I progressed, I introduced procedural animations and shader effects, adding vibrancy and fluidity to the visuals. Finally, all elements were combined in After Effects, where the layering techniques brought a sense of depth and cohesion to the overall composition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to create an experience that captures the feeling of organic growth, where visuals unfold and evolve, much like nature itself.
